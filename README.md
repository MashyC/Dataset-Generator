# Dataset-Generator
Generates a dataset, useful for CNN's or other image processing programs using Haar Cascade's and Live Webcam feed.
When a person is identified by the webcam, the program will autocrop the face and save a 128x128 .jpg every tick as long as a face is detected.
These images can be used for training purposes in the Neural Net.
